# Monitor-Raspberry
 Homemade smart home web interface

Everything is planned to be hosted on a PHP server in a Raspberry PI 4. Though, it is possible to host it on any device that has internet access and a webcam.

In order to see the webcam content, I developped 'webcam.py' that constantly updates a 'feed.png' file, allowing to process itself for motion detection.
